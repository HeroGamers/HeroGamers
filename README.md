## Hi there, I'm Hero ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hero, and I'm going for the MSc programme in Computer Science and Engineering~

I currently live in Denmark, and I'm currently on my third year of studying on the [Higher Technical Examination Programme](https://eng.uvm.dk/upper-secondary-education/national-upper-secondary-education-programmes/the-higher-technical-examination-programme--htx-) (abbr. HTX), which is a three-year technical upper secondary education programme.

I spend most of my time in school or working. I'm currently working as a swim coach as well as a ride operator at a local amusement park. In my free time I work on whatever projects I have on my hands currently, chat around on my Discord Community, [Treeland](https://discord.gg/PvFPEfd), as well as manage the Danish Gaming Community, [DoggyCraft](https://www.facebook.com/DoggyCraftDK/), where we also have a group of awesome nerds creating awesome open-sourced stuff as well, [which you can check out here!](https://github.com/DoggyCraft)

Well, thanks for swinging by my profile! Cheers!  
~ Love, Hero <3
