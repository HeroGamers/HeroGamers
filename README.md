## Hi there, I'm Hero ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hero, and I'm going for the MSc programme in Computer Science and Engineering~

I currently live in Denmark, and I'm studying [Software Technology](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/bachelor-beng-and-bsc-/beng/software-technology) at the Technical University of Denmark.

I spend most of my time in school or working. I've worked as a swim coach as well as a ride operator at a local amusement park in the past. In my free time I work on whatever projects I have on my hands currently, chat around on my Discord Community, [Treeland](https://discord.gg/PvFPEfd), as well as manage the Danish Gaming Community, [DoggyCraft](https://www.facebook.com/DoggyCraftDK/), where we also have a group of awesome nerds creating awesome open-sourced stuff as well, [which you can check out here](https://github.com/DoggyCraft)!

Well, thanks for swinging by my profile! Cheers!  
~ Love, Hero <3
